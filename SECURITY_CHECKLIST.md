# 🔐 MobiAPI Security Checklist (Inspired by Stripe)

This document outlines essential security practices to protect MobiAPI from end to end — from payment requests to payouts. These principles are based on Stripe-grade architecture, adapted for mobile money use cases (Wave, Orange Money, etc.).

---

## ✅ Core Principles

- **Security by Design**: Built-in from the start, not added later.
- **Zero Trust**: Always verify, never assume trust between systems.
- **Minimize Surface Area**: Only expose what’s absolutely necessary.

---

## 1. 🔒 HTTPS & TLS

- Enforce HTTPS everywhere (TLS 1.2+)
- Redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS
- Use certificates from Let’s Encrypt or Cloudflare

---

## 2. 🔐 Authentication & Authorization

### For External Developers (Merchants):
- Use API Keys with scopes (`read_only`, `write_payments`, etc.)
- Implement OAuth2 or Firebase Auth
- Rate limit requests by IP + API Key
- Support key rotation and revocation

### For Admins:
- Require email/password + 2FA
- Use role-based access (`admin`, `support`, `finance`)
- Log every admin action

---

## 3. 🔁 Webhook Verification

- Verify all callbacks (from Wave, Orange) using HMAC or secret tokens
- Add a timestamp to prevent replay attacks
- Only accept from whitelisted IPs or signed requests

---

## 4. 🧱 Database Security

- Use Firestore rules or SQL permissions
- Encrypt PII and wallet IDs (AES-256 at rest)
- Access logs on sensitive collections (`payments`, `payouts`, `users`)

---

## 5. 🧮 Ledger System

- Use a dedicated `ledger` collection or table
- Every transaction = immutable record:
  - `type` (payment, payout, refund)
  - `amount`, `currency`, `user_id`, `status`, `timestamp`
  - `source_wallet`, `destination_wallet`
- Never modify or delete ledger entries — only append

---

## 6. ⚠️ Rate Limiting & Abuse Protection

- Throttle requests per IP and per merchant
- Detect abuse patterns (failed payments, bot attempts)
- Use Firebase App Check or Cloudflare DDoS protection

---

## 7. 🔐 End-to-End Encryption

- All traffic = HTTPS + JWT for auth
- Encrypt data in Firestore at field level if sensitive (e.g., wallet IDs)
- Use Google Cloud KMS or Firebase’s built-in encryption

---

## 8. 🛡️ Payout Security

- Allow payouts only to verified merchants
- Require second-factor auth for large payouts (OTP/email confirm)
- Log payout attempts (IP, device, amount, wallet, user)

---

## 9. 🕵️ Fraud Detection (Basic Rules)

- New wallets can’t do large payments
- Block suspicious IPs (VPN, TOR, proxy)
- Delay payouts for risky transactions until verified

---

## 10. 📉 Monitoring & Logging

- Log every API call, payment, and payout
- Monitor anomalies (sudden spikes, failures, high-risk patterns)
- Use tools: Firebase Crashlytics, Sentry, or Datadog

---

## 11. 🧪 Testing & Penetration

- Regularly run security tests:
  - Input validation
  - Replay attacks
  - API fuzzing
- Schedule external audits or bug bounty testing

---

## 12. 📦 Vendor and Third-Party API Security

- Only integrate with vetted APIs (Wave, Orange)
- Do not store third-party secrets in source code
- Rotate secrets regularly

---

## 📌 Pro Tips

- Limit what you store. Don’t store unnecessary PII.
- Default to "deny" in your Firestore or backend policies.
- Give merchants a **dashboard** to track balances and payouts (but never direct access to sensitive operations).

### 🔚 Final Note

Mobi is more than a product. It's a platform that will handle thousands of mobile payments. **Security = trust**, and trust is your real currency.

Build it like you know a hacker is watching — because they probably are.
