   - Try webhook without signature (should be rejected in production)
   - Test with invalid IP (should be rejected)
   - Verify signature validation works

3. **Test Payment Flow**:
   - Create payment with Wave
   - Create payment with Orange Money
   - Verify webhook processing

The Mobys API now has production-ready payment processing with enterprise-grade security, comprehensive logging, and automatic error recovery! 🎉
