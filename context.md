# Mobys API â€” Project Context

## Overview
Mobys is a developer-first payments API that enables businesses and developers in Francophone West Africa to accept mobile money payments from customers via providers like **Orange Money** and **Wave**.

The goal is to create a clean, unified API for initiating and confirming mobile payments across major providers, starting with Mali, CÃ´te d'Ivoire, and Senegal. Future versions may expand to other African countries and include additional providers like Moov and MTN.

## Target Users
- Software developers building e-commerce sites, marketplaces, SaaS apps
- Freelancers who want to accept mobile money on websites
- Small businesses offering payment links or embedded checkouts

## Core MVP Features

### 1. `POST /pay`
- Initiates a mobile money payment
- Accepts payment method (`orange_money` or `wave`), amount, currency (`XOF`), and phone number
- For Orange Money, returns a redirect URL for user to complete payment
- For Wave, sends a payment request and returns a short URL to Wave's payment page

### 2. `POST /webhook/payment` (or provider-specific webhooks)
- Endpoint to receive asynchronous confirmations from providers
- Orange Money redirects with status after user completes payment
- Wave sends a webhook to confirm payment success or failure
- Updates transaction status to `success` or `failed` in Firestore

### 3. API Key Authentication
- Each request to `/pay` requires an `Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>` header
- Keys are stored in a Firestore collection
- API key limits can be set per user (e.g., 1000 requests/month)

## ðŸ§¾ Payment Lifecycle (Updated for Fund Holding and Payouts)

Mobys now follows a **Stripe-like architecture** where payments are first collected by Mobys, held briefly, then disbursed to the merchant's mobile wallet after confirmation.

### Lifecycle Breakdown:

1. **Payment Intent Creation (`POST /pay`)**
   - Merchant creates a payment intent via API.
   - Mobys triggers a payment request to Wave or Orange Money.

2. **Payment Authorization**
   - User receives prompt on their mobile (USSD, push, or payment URL).
   - User confirms the transaction on their device.

3. **Provider Callback / Webhook**
   - Wave or Orange Money sends a confirmation webhook.
   - Mobys verifies it and updates the transaction to `succeeded` or `failed`.

4. **Ledger Entry Creation**
   - Upon confirmation, Mobys writes a **ledger entry**:
     - Type: `payment`
     - Status: `succeeded`
     - Source wallet, destination (Mobys), amount, currency, timestamps.

5. **Merchant Balance Update**
   - The merchant's **available balance** in Mobys is updated (calculated from the ledger).

6. **Payout Request or Auto-Payout**
   - Mobys triggers a **payout** (manual or scheduled).
   - Creates a new ledger entry of type `payout` with full traceability.
   - Sends money from Mobys's Wave/Orange wallet to the merchant's mobile money wallet.

## ðŸ§® Ledger System

All financial operations are tracked via a structured ledger system to ensure accuracy, traceability, and auditability.

Each ledger record includes:
- `type`: `payment`, `payout`, or `refund`
- `status`: `pending`, `succeeded`, or `failed`
- `amount`, `currency`, `user_id`
- `source_wallet`, `destination_wallet`
- Timestamps and reference metadata

Balances are **never stored directly** â€” they're calculated by summing all ledger entries per merchant.

## Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js + Express (via Firebase Functions)
- **Database**: Firestore
- **Auth**: Custom API key middleware
- **Third-Party Providers**: Orange Money & Wave (v1)
- **Payments Testing**: Use Orange and Wave public APIs or simulate flows
- **Hosting**: Firebase Hosting + Vercel (optional)
- **Docs**: Swagger UI or Markdown-based API docs
- **Frontend**: Later phase may include hosted checkout page

## Example: Request & Response

### `POST /pay` (Wave)
```json
{
  "amount": 5000,
  "currency": "XOF",
  "method": "wave",
  "phone": "+22391234567",
  "metadata": {
    "order_id": "ORD-1234"
  }
}
```

### `POST /pay` (Orange)
```json
{
  "amount": 5000,
  "currency": "XOF",
  "method": "orange_money",
  "phone": "+22391234567",
  "metadata": {
    "order_id": "ORD-5678"
  }
}
```

### Orange Redirect Response (after payment):
```
GET /callback/orange?order_id=ORD-5678&status=SUCCESS
```

### Wave Webhook Payload:
```json
{
  "transaction_id": "txn_abc123",
  "status": "success",
  "provider": "wave",
  "amount": 5000,
  "phone": "+22391234567"
}
```

## Non-Goals for MVP
- No dashboard or UI in the MVP (just API)
- No bank integrations (mobile money only)
- No KYC or full payment processor licensing

## Future Ideas
- Add hosted checkout experience (like Stripe Checkout)
- Expand to other providers (MTN, Airtel, Moov)
- Add invoicing, recurring billing, receipts
- Partner with fintechs or launch as a SaaS for African startups
